# Sequential Thinking Methodology

## Overview

The Sequential Thinking Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a structured approach to problem-solving that allows for dynamic adaptation and revision of thought processes. This methodology is particularly effective for solving linear programming problems.

## Key Components

1. **Thought Structure**
   - Regular analytical steps
   - Revisions of previous thoughts
   - Questions about previous decisions
   - Realizations about needing more analysis
   - Changes in approach
   - Hypothesis generation
   - Hypothesis verification

2. **Process Parameters**
   - thought_number: Current step in the sequence
   - total_thoughts: Estimated steps needed
   - next_thought_needed: Indicates if more analysis is required
   - is_revision: Marks revisions to previous thoughts
   - revises_thought: References the thought being revised

## Methodology Steps

1. **Problem Definition**
   - Identify variables
   - State objective function
   - List constraints

2. **Initial Analysis**
   - Break down problem components
   - Identify key relationships
   - Map out solution approach

3. **Sequential Solution**
   - Process step by step
   - Document each thought
   - Allow for revisions

4. **Verification**
   - Check constraints
   - Validate solutions
   - Consider alternatives

5. **Conclusion**
   - Summarize final solution
   - Document key insights
   - Note any potential improvements
