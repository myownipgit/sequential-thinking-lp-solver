# Core Sequential Thinking Methodology

## What is Sequential Thinking?

Sequential Thinking is a structured approach to problem-solving that breaks down complex problems into manageable steps while maintaining the ability to revise and adapt the solution process. This methodology is particularly powerful when combined with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for solving Linear Programming problems.

## Core Principles

1. **Structured Decomposition**
   - Break down complex problems into discrete steps
   - Maintain clear relationships between steps
   - Build solutions progressively

2. **Adaptive Thinking**
   - Allow for revision of previous steps
   - Support multiple solution paths
   - Enable dynamic problem-solving

3. **Context Preservation**
   - Maintain problem context throughout
   - Track dependencies between steps
   - Document assumptions and decisions

## Key Components

### 1. Thought Structure
Each thought in the sequence contains:
- Clear statement of current step
- Relationship to previous steps
- Progress towards solution
- Verification elements

### 2. Process Parameters
Essential tracking elements:
- `thoughtNumber`: Position in sequence
- `totalThoughts`: Estimated steps needed
- `nextThoughtNeeded`: Progress indicator
- `isRevision`: Revision tracker
- `revisesThought`: Reference to revised step

## Application Process

### 1. Problem Definition
- Identify key variables
- State constraints
- Define objectives
- List assumptions

### 2. Solution Development
- Progress step by step
- Document each thought
- Show calculations
- Verify intermediate results

### 3. Solution Verification
- Check all constraints
- Validate calculations
- Consider alternatives
- Document conclusions

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Documentation
- Write explicit thoughts
- Show all work
- Explain reasoning
- Note assumptions

### 2. Systematic Verification
- Check each step
- Validate against constraints
- Test edge cases
- Consider alternatives

### 3. Revision Management
- Track changes clearly
- Explain revisions
- Maintain history
- Document impacts

## Example Structure

```python
# Step 1: Problem Definition
Thought: "Identify variables and constraints..."
Number: 1
Total: 5
NextNeeded: True

# Step 2: Initial Analysis
Thought: "Calculate initial boundaries..."
Number: 2
Total: 5
NextNeeded: True

# Step 3: Solution Development
Thought: "Solve key equations..."
Number: 3
Total: 5
NextNeeded: True

# Step 4: Verification
Thought: "Check all constraints..."
Number: 4
Total: 5
NextNeeded: True

# Step 5: Conclusion
Thought: "Finalize optimal solution..."
Number: 5
Total: 5
NextNeeded: False
```

## Integration with MCP

The Sequential Thinking methodology integrates seamlessly with MCP servers to provide:
1. Structured problem-solving interface
2. Context maintenance
3. Revision capabilities
4. Solution verification
5. Documentation support

## Applications in Linear Programming

Sequential Thinking is particularly effective for LP problems:
1. Clear problem definition
2. Systematic constraint analysis
3. Step-by-step solution development
4. Comprehensive verification
5. Optimal solution identification
