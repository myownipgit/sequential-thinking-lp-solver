# Problem Variations and Additional Constraints

## 1. Minimum Production Requirements

### Problem Variation
Add minimum production requirements:
- Must produce at least 5 Tables per day (hotel chain contract)
- Must produce at least 8 Chairs per day (market demand)

### Modified Prompt
```
Using Sequential Thinking MCP, solve this Linear Programming Problem with additional constraints:

A furniture manufacturer produces two types of products: **Chairs** and **Tables**. Each Chair requires **2 hours** of labor and **3 kg** of wood, while each Table requires **4 hours** of labor and **5 kg** of wood. The company has **40 hours** of labor and **60 kg** of wood available per day. The profit for each Chair is **$30**, and for each Table, it is **$50**.

Additional requirements:
• Must produce at least 5 Tables per day (hotel chain contract)
• Must produce at least 8 Chairs per day (market demand)
• The company wants to maximize daily profit while staying within all constraints.

How many Chairs and Tables should the company produce daily?
```

### Solution with Additional Constraints

#### New Constraints Added:
```
4. Minimum Tables: y ≥ 5
5. Minimum Chairs: x ≥ 8
```

#### Solution Steps Using Sequential Thinking:
1. Start with minimum Tables (y = 5):
   - Labor remaining: 40 - (4 × 5) = 20 hours
   - Wood remaining: 60 - (5 × 5) = 35 kg

2. Calculate maximum possible Chairs:
   - Labor allows: 20 ÷ 2 = 10 Chairs
   - Wood allows: 35 ÷ 3 ≈ 11.67 Chairs
   - Therefore limited to 10 Chairs

3. Final Solution:
   - 10 Chairs (meets minimum of 8)
   - 5 Tables (meets minimum of 5)
   - Total profit: (10 × $30) + (5 × $50) = $550

## 2. Other Possible Variations

### Quality Requirements
- Add quality inspection time
- Different wood grades for different products
- Maximum defect rates

### Market Constraints
- Maximum market demand limits
- Price elasticity considerations
- Seasonal variations

### Resource Variations
- Multiple types of wood
- Different skill levels of labor
- Machine capacity constraints

## Using the Sequential Thinking Approach

For each variation:
1. Clearly identify new constraints
2. Update the mathematical model
3. Solve step by step
4. Verify all constraints
5. Document assumptions
6. Consider sensitivity analysis

This demonstrates how the Sequential Thinking MCP can handle increasingly complex scenarios while maintaining a structured approach to problem-solving.
