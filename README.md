# Sequential Thinking MCP Server - LP Solver

This repository demonstrates how to solve Linear Programming (LP) problems using the Sequential Thinking Model Context Protocol (MCP). The approach breaks down complex optimization problems into systematic, verifiable steps while maintaining flexibility for revisions and alternative paths.

## Understanding MCP Servers

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables secure, two-way connections between AI models and various tools and data sources. Think of it like USB-C for AI - it provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

In our case, we're using the Sequential Thinking MCP Server, which provides structured problem-solving capabilities through a client-host-server architecture. This allows us to:
- Break down complex problems systematically
- Maintain solution context throughout the process
- Revise and adapt our thinking as needed
- Connect with other tools and data sources when necessary

## Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Documentation and methodology
