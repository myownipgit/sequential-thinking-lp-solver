# Sequential Thinking LP Solver

This repository demonstrates how to solve Linear Programming (LP) problems using the Sequential Thinking Model Context Protocol (MCP). The approach breaks down complex optimization problems into systematic, verifiable steps while maintaining flexibility for revisions and alternative paths.

## Prerequisites

This solution uses the Claude Desktop App, which provides access to Anthropic's Claude AI assistant and the Sequential Thinking MCP server. You can access Claude through:
- [Claude Desktop App](https://anthropic.com/claude)
- [Claude Web Interface](https://claude.ai)
- [Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs)

## Understanding MCP Servers

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables secure, two-way connections between AI models and various tools and data sources. Think of it like USB-C for AI - it provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

In our case, we're using the Sequential Thinking MCP Server through Claude Desktop App, which provides structured problem-solving capabilities through a client-host-server architecture. This allows us to:
- Break down complex problems systematically
- Maintain solution context throughout the process
- Revise and adapt our thinking as needed
- Connect with other tools and data sources when necessary

## Repository Structure

## Getting Started

1. Install and set up the [Claude Desktop App](https://anthropic.com/claude)
2. Review the methodology in `docs/methodology.md`
3. Understand MCP Servers in `docs/mcp_servers.md`
4. Check out the example problem in `examples/furniture_manufacturing.md`
5. Use the template from `templates/sequential_thinking_template.md` for your own problems

## Using with Claude

When using Claude to solve Linear Programming problems:
1. Access Claude through any of the available interfaces
2. Use the provided templates and examples as reference
3. Leverage the Sequential Thinking MCP for structured problem-solving
4. Follow the comprehensive guide in the documentation
