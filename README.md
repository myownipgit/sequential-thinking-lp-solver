# Sequential Thinking LP Solver

This repository demonstrates how to solve Linear Programming (LP) problems using the Sequential Thinking Model Context Protocol (MCP). The approach breaks down complex optimization problems into systematic, verifiable steps while maintaining flexibility for revisions and alternative paths.

## Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Documentation and methodology
- `examples/`: Example problems and solutions
- `templates/`: Templates for applying the sequential thinking process

## Getting Started

1. Review the methodology in `docs/methodology.md`
2. Check out the example problem in `examples/furniture_manufacturing.md`
3. Use the template from `templates/sequential_thinking_template.md` for your own problems
